# Game Server

<details>

<summary>Would I need to do any port forwarding?</summary>

Since we host the server on your behalf, there is no port forwarding necessary, we've taken care of that for you

<summary>How long does it take to set up my server?</summary>

Normally it should be up within minutes if not seconds.\
Look for an email that tells you that the server is installed, at that point you have been issued a server.
