Rust seems to be one of these games where the devs (Facepunch) work very hard to keep the master server list as clean as possible which is not a bad thing. \
\
Below is some reasons why it may not be listed.

{% step %}
Steam Query Limits (10,000-Server Cap)

Steam’s server browser **can only handle querying up to 10,000 servers at once.**

* This means when more then 10,000 Rust servers are active some will simply not be visable
{% endstep %}

* Facepunch hide servers with 0 Players from the browser
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
