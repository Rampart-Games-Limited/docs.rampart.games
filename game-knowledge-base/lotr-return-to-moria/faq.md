<summary>Can multiple people be admins?</summary>

Return to Moria does not have a traditional admin/permission system like other survival games.\
Instead, **the host controls the world**, and all players share gameplay permissions.

Return to Moria supports **up to 8 players** in a multiplayer session.

<summary>Can I run mods on a Return to Moria server?</summary>

As of now, the game does **not officially support modding** or modded servers.\
However this is your game server and we want you to feel free todo as you please, therefore if you can mod, mod away :smile:

<summary>Can different platforms play together? (Crossplay)</summary>

Crossplay availability depends on the store platform and the game’s update status.\
Check current game platform notes to confirm compatibility between Steam, Epic, and console versions.

<summary>How do I change difficulty or world settings?</summary>

Currently, world settings like difficulty, resource abundance, or enemy scaling are limited.\
You set some options during world creation, but once the world exists, settings are very restricted.

More advanced configuration may be added in future updates.
