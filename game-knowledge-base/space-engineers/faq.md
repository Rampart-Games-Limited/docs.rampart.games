<summary>Where is my mod Directory?</summary>

The path is:\
**C:\Users\\{YOUR WINDOWS USERNAME}\AppData\Roaming\SpaceEngineers\Mods**

Note that AppData is by default in windows a hidden folder, so if you cannot find it, you need to unhide folders.\
\
For Quick access try:\
1\) press WIN+R to open command prompt\
2\) paste **%APPDATA%** and press Enter.

Each mod has a folder of it's own located in:\
&#xNAN;**\Users\\{username}\AppData\Roaming\SpaceEngineers\Mods\\{mod name}**

The mod folder has to contain a sub-folder called **Data** with definition files of added or updated mods.&#x20;
